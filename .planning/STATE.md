## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Pre-Phase 1]: Book/BookCopy split locked in first migration — cannot be retrofitted
- [Pre-Phase 1]: Every Server Action must call `requireRole()` independently — middleware is UX-only (CVE-2025-29927)
- [Pre-Phase 1]: All date columns use `@db.Timestamptz`; all due-date logic in UTC
- [Pre-Phase 1]: Checkout uses `prisma.$transaction` with `SELECT FOR UPDATE` to prevent availability race condition
- [Pre-Phase 1]: Docker-first dev environment from commit 1; Railway for production (persistent node-cron process)
- [Phase 01 review]: /books/[id] is accessible to all authenticated users; isLibrarian passed as prop gates management UI — same page serves member read-only and librarian CRUD views

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- [Pre-Phase 1]: Deployment target (Railway vs Vercel) determines Phase 4 cron architecture — Railway assumed; confirm before Phase 4 planning
- [Pre-Phase 1]: Default loan durations (student vs faculty) and fine rate need confirmation before Phase 2 planning (can seed with defaults)
- [Pre-Phase 1]: Reservation pickup window (default 48h) should be confirmed before Phase 3 planning

## Deferred Items

| Category | Item | Status | Deferred At |

| Auth | OAuth login (Google, GitHub) | v2 backlog | Roadmap |
| Auth | Two-factor authentication | v2 backlog | Roadmap |
| Catalog | Bulk CSV import | v2 backlog | Roadmap |
| Notifications | In-app notification bell | v2 backlog | Roadmap |
| Admin | Configurable policies via UI | v2 backlog | Roadmap |
